# Motivation

Important questions should not be forgotten, especially as the pace of innovation churns out seemingly new things. My hypothesis is that there are actually very few completely new things and that by asking the fundamental questions, we can make better sense of the world around us.

There are currently no great ways for me to know which questions I'm not asking. I only have answers to questions I know to ask. People can argue more easily about answers, whereas I think people can agree on important questions. For me, this can potentially get around our current media culture that feeds answers instead of getting us to consider the important questions.

## Example

I read [this article](http://nautil.us/issue/68/context/how-well-forget-john-lennon) about our cultural memory and how the medium controls the types of things that are remembered. For example, when writing first came out, the kind of people we remember are scientists and composers because they benefitted most from this innovation. As time went on, radio, tv, and eventually the internet came out. Each of these benefitted a different type of communications and thus we remember different people in each of these eras.

This was especially interesting and showed me the importance of asking the question regarding mediums and which can be applied across all mediums.

```
Who benefits the most from this medium?
```

Or in other words, what types of messages are best served in this medium.

## Proposal

The first naive way to think about this is to create `labels`. For example, our first label could be `communication medium`. Each label has a set of `questions` that are ranked by importance.

```
[communication medium]

1. What types of messages are best served in this medium?
2. What is the speed of dissemination of this medium?
3. ...
```

The last pieces are `subjects` which can have many labels.

```
Facebook [communication medium] [technology company]
```

Based on the labels, we have a combined and sorted set of questions that should be answered in order to have a deeper understanding of the subject at hand.
