# Abstract

We are all ignorant of many things. This does not mean we're flawed, there is often too many things that we want to be on top of. Especially now with the pace of innovation increasing. It's a healthy practice to be aware and open about these so we can focus on the ones we really want to address instead of feeling depressed about one's own ignorance all the time.
